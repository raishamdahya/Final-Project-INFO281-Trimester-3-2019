# INFO281
Data analytics project for INFO281 Victoria University of Wellington

The main theme for this course was to explore issues within New Zealand which could use public data and be transformed into a dashboard to present interesting patterns and findings. For my issue, I wanted to explore income inequality within New Zealand. 

After using many public platforms to find data, my dashboard came down to explore income inequality within the five main areas: inequality in income between the North and South island; female and male pay-gap differences between 1998-2019; weekly female and male pay-gap differences between different industry sectors; weekly income differences between types of qualifications between male and female and weekly/hourly income differences between ethnicities.

For this project I used flexdashboard as my dashboard tool and the plotly library to make the dashboard interactive.

Based on both the graphs for the north and south island, its evident that Auckland and Wellington have the highest weekly earnings above $1200 on average for the North and South island.

On average the pay-gap has decreased from 1998 to 2019. With the gap starting at 16%, falling to 14% in 2005 and less than 10% 2015 onwards.
